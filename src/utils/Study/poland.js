      <p>International students can study in our partner universities
        in Poland. Thanks to the partial tuition waiver scholarships offered
        by these universities an international student can pay an average
        cost of 2,500 EUR to 3500 EUR per year for undergraduate,
        postgraduate, and Vocational courses. Poland's cost of living is
        also surprisingly low and lower than in most other
        European countries.
